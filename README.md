# Little Esty Shop

This project is an extension of the Little Esty Shop group project assigned in Mod 2 at Turing Schoool of Software and design. Little Esty Shop is a fictional e-commerce platform where merchants and admins can manage inventory and fulfill customer invoices. In this extension, I have added functionality for merchants to create bulk discounts for their items. A “bulk discount” is a discount based on the quantity of items the customer is buying, for example “20% off orders of 10 or more items”.

## Learning Goals
- Write migrations to create tables and relationships between tables
- Implement CRUD functionality for a resource using forms (form_tag or form_with), buttons, and links
- Use MVC to organize code effectively, limiting the amount of logic included in views and controllers
- Use built-in ActiveRecord methods to join multiple tables of data, make calculations, and group data based on one or more attributes
- Write model tests that fully cover the data logic of the application
- Write feature tests that fully cover the functionality of the application
